# PersuadeVue: Empowering Marketing Content

## Overview

A simple and fast way to browse the latest news from Hacker News, a popular social news website for programmers and entrepreneurs. It uses the official Hacker News API1, which provides near real-time access to the stories, comments, users, and other data from Hacker News. My website allows users to search for news by keywords, tags, authors, or dates, and displays the results in a user-friendly interface. Users can also view the details of each story, such as the title, URL, score, number of comments, and the text of the top comments. My website aims to provide a convenient and enjoyable experience for Hacker News fans and newcomers alike.
## Accomplishments

- Designed and developed a user-friendly frontend interface using the latest Frontend tools (React.js, Redux, TypeScript) stack, ensuring high interactivity and responsiveness.
- Implemented Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to automate testing, integration, and deployment processes, enhancing development efficiency and code quality.
- Utilized NoSQL databases for efficient data storage and management, optimizing database queries and ensuring data integrity.

## Challenges

- One of the challenges I faced was dealing with the rate limits and errors of the Hacker News API, which sometimes resulted in incomplete or outdated data.
- Due to the desire to maintain control and avoid external dependencies, we chose to build every feature custom, even if pre-existing libraries or frameworks were available. This approach aimed to keep the project as prone-free as possible and foster deeper learning and understanding of the underlying technologies.

## Future Work

- Introduce new ways of comment layout inspired by platforms like Reddit to enhance user engagement and interaction.
- Modify the user interface to be more intuitive and human-centric, taking cues from best practices in UX/UI design.
- Implement a notification system similar to LinkedIn and other platforms to alert users about new updates, features, and trending content.
- Explore additional features such as real-time analytics, personalized recommendations, and advanced video editing tools to further enhance the application's capabilities and user experience.

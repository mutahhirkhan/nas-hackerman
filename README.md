A simple and fast way to browse the latest news from Hacker News, a popular social news website for programmers and entrepreneurs. It uses the official Hacker News API1[https://github.com/HackerNews/API], which provides near real-time access to the stories, comments, users, and other data from Hacker News. My website allows users to search for news by keywords, tags, authors, or dates, and displays the results in a user-friendly interface. Users can also view the details of each story, such as the title, URL, score, number of comments, and the text of the top comments. My website aims to provide a convenient and enjoyable experience for Hacker News fans and newcomers alike.
